- **Customizability**: Each component can be customized through props, allowing you to tailor them to your project's specific needs.
- **Easy Integration**: Import the components directly into your React application and start using them immediately.
- **Development Efficiency**: Reduce development time by reusing well-tested and well-documented components.
